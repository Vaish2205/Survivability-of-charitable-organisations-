# Survivability of charitable organisations ‚Äì What factors influence whether a charity survives?

This ongoing project investigates **what factors influence the survival** of charitable organisations in the UK by analyzing comprehensive administrative data from the UK Charity Commission.

## Project Goal
To explore and identify key variables ‚Äî such as financial health, age, legal structure, governance quality, and operational characteristics ‚Äî that contribute to whether a charity continues operating or ceases operations.

## Datasets Explored

### 1. UK Charity Commission Dataset (Selected)
- **Source**: Charity Commission for England and Wales full register download
- **Scale**: 392,350 registered charities across 13 interconnected tables
- **Coverage**: 1960s - 2024
- **Total Records**: 8+ million across all tables
- **Includes**:
  - Core organizational information (registration, legal structure, contact details)
  - Financial data (income, expenditure, reserves)
  - Governance information (trustees, policies)
  - Operational details (activities, beneficiaries, geographic scope)
  - Regulatory history and compliance records

### 2. Companies House Dataset (Explored but not used)
- **Scale**: 5.66 million UK companies
- **Reason for exclusion**: Focus on charity-specific factors rather than general business patterns
- **Decision rationale**: Charity Commission data provides sector-specific variables more relevant to charitable organization survival

## Research Questions

### Main Research Question
**Survivability of charitable organisations ‚Äì What factors influence whether a charity survives?**

### Sub-Research Questions
- **RQ1:** What organizational demographics and structural characteristics differentiate surviving charities from those that cease operations?
- **RQ2:** How do financial characteristics and resource patterns influence survival probability across charity income segments?
- **RQ3:** Which governance and operational factors exhibit the strongest association with charity survival outcomes?
- **RQ4:** How can advanced feature engineering extract predictive signals from charity administrative data to improve survival prediction accuracy?
- **RQ5:** What modeling approach and validation framework optimizes both predictive performance and interpretability for charity sector decision-making applications?

## Project Phases

- **Phase 1**: Data acquisition & cleaning from 13 tables
- **Phase 2**: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) for charity survival trends
- **Phase 3**: Data integration & master dataset creation
- **Phase 4**: Advanced feature engineering (organizational, financial, governance)
- **Phase 5**: Feature selection and validation
- **Phase 6**: Logistic regression modeling and evaluation

## Project Status
- [x] Research questions defined  
- [x] Datasets loaded and explored

## üìå Project Overview  
This project investigates the determinants of survival among charitable organisations in the UK. Despite their social and economic significance, many charities face sustainability challenges. Using comprehensive administrative records from the **UK Charity Commission**, this study applies advanced data science techniques to explore which factors most strongly influence whether a charity continues operating or ceases operations.  

The project contributes both **theoretical insights** into nonprofit organisational survival and **practical tools** to support evidence-based decision-making for charity leaders, funders, and policymakers.

## üéØ Research Goal  
To identify organisational, financial, governance, and operational factors that influence the survival of UK charities, and to build interpretable predictive models that support the sector‚Äôs sustainability.

## üìÇ Datasets  

### 1. UK Charity Commission Dataset (Primary)  
- **Source:** [Charity Commission for England and Wales](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/en/)  
- **Coverage:** 1960s ‚Äì 2024  
- **Scale:** 392,350 registered charities across 13 interconnected tables  
- **Total Records:** 8+ million  
- **Includes:**  
  - Organisational details (registration, legal structure, governing docs)  
  - Financial data (income, expenditure, reserves)  
  - Governance (trustees, policies)  
  - Operations (activities, beneficiaries, geographic scope)  
  - Compliance and regulatory history  

### 2. Companies House Dataset (Explored, Not Used)  
- **Scale:** 5.66 million UK companies  
- **Reason for Exclusion:** Lacks sector-specific governance and compliance data relevant to charities.

## üìä Key Findings  

- **Top predictors of survival:**  
  - Governance quality (board size, oversight strength)  
  - Younger organisational age (short-term resilience advantage)  
  - Financial thresholds (income > ¬£10,000)  
  - Recency of operational activity and compliance  
  - Modern legal structures (e.g., Charitable Incorporated Organisations)  

- **Model Performance (Logistic Regression):**  
  - Accuracy: **81.6%**  
  - Recall (identifying at-risk charities): **99.0%**  

- **Implications:**  
  - Challenges some aspects of lifecycle theory (younger charities can be more resilient).  
  - Governance emerges as the strongest determinant of survival.  
  - Provides a prototype **web tool** for funders/regulators to assess risk in real time.
