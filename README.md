# Survivability of charitable organisations – What factors influence whether a charity survives?

This ongoing project investigates **what factors influence the survival** of charitable organisations in the UK by analyzing comprehensive administrative data from the UK Charity Commission.

## Project Goal
To explore and identify key variables — such as financial health, age, legal structure, governance quality, and operational characteristics — that contribute to whether a charity continues operating or ceases operations.

## Datasets Explored

### 1. UK Charity Commission Dataset (Selected)
- **Source**: Charity Commission for England and Wales full register download
- **Scale**: 392,350 registered charities across 13 interconnected tables
- **Coverage**: 1960s - 2024
- **Total Records**: 8,033,850 across all tables
- **Includes**:
  - Core organizational information (registration, legal structure, contact details)
  - Financial data (income, expenditure, reserves)
  - Governance information (trustees, policies)
  - Operational details (activities, beneficiaries, geographic scope)
  - Regulatory history and compliance records

### 2. Companies House Dataset (Explored but not used)
- **Scale**: 5.66 million UK companies
- **Reason for exclusion**: Focus on charity-specific factors rather than general business patterns
- **Decision rationale**: Charity Commission data provides sector-specific variables more relevant to charitable organization survival

## Research Questions

### Main Research Question
**Survivability of charitable organisations – What factors influence whether a charity survives?**

### Sub-Research Questions
- **RQ1:** What organizational demographics and structural characteristics differentiate surviving charities from those that cease operations?
- **RQ2:** How do financial characteristics and resource patterns influence survival probability across charity income segments?
- **RQ3:** Which governance and operational factors exhibit the strongest association with charity survival outcomes?
- **RQ4:** How can advanced feature engineering extract predictive signals from charity administrative data to improve survival prediction accuracy?
- **RQ5:** What modeling approach and validation framework optimizes both predictive performance and interpretability for charity sector decision-making applications?

## Project Phases

- **Phase 1**: Data acquisition & cleaning from 13 tables
- **Phase 2**: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) for charity survival trends
- **Phase 3**: Data integration & master dataset creation
- **Phase 4**: Advanced feature engineering (organizational, financial, governance)
- **Phase 5**: Feature selection and validation
- **Phase 6**: Logistic regression modeling and evaluation
