# Survivability-of-charitable-organisations

This ongoing project investigates **what factors influence the survival** of charitable organisations in the UK by analyzing a combination of charity operational data and regional socioeconomic indicators.

## Project Goal

To explore and identify key variables — such as financial health, age, sector, and local economic conditions — that contribute to whether a charity continues operating or not.


##  Datasets Used

1. **UK Charity Dataset**
   - Details about UK-registered charities
   - Includes:
     - Financials (income, donations, government grants)
     - Operational data (sector, classification, trustee counts)
     - Registration and dissolution dates
     - Geographic details (postcode, region)

2. **Housing / Socioeconomic Dataset**
   - Regional indicators of economic health
   - Includes:
     - Average household income
     - Unemployment rates
     - Area-level deprivation or housing data
   - Will be merged with charity data by postcode or region


##  Research Questions

### Main Question:
What factors from both charity operational data and local socioeconomic indicators influence the survivability of charitable organizations?

###  Sub-Questions:
1. **Financial Health**  
   How does a charity’s financial status (e.g., income, donations) impact its likelihood of survival?

2. **Sector or Area of Focus**  
   Are certain types of charities (e.g., education, health) more likely to survive?

3. **Age and Experience**  
   Does the length of time a charity has operated affect its survival?

4. **Socioeconomic Context**  
   How do local factors like average income or economic deprivation impact survival rates?

5. **Cohort and Environment**  
   Are charities founded more recently less likely to survive, especially in disadvantaged regions?
