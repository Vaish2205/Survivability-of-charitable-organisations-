# Survivability-of-charitable-organisations

This ongoing project investigates **what factors influence the survival** of charitable organisations in the UK by analyzing a combination of charity operational data and regional socioeconomic indicators.

## Project Goal

To explore and identify key variables — such as financial health, age, sector, and local economic conditions — that contribute to whether a charity continues operating or not.


##  Datasets Used

1. **UK Charity Dataset**
   - Details about UK-registered charities
   - Includes:
     - Financials (income, donations, government grants)
     - Operational data (sector, classification, trustee counts)
     - Registration and dissolution dates
     - Geographic details (postcode, region)

2. **Housing / Socioeconomic Dataset**
   - Regional indicators of economic health
   - Includes:
     - Average household income
     - Unemployment rates
     - Area-level deprivation or housing data
   - Will be merged with charity data by postcode or region

# Research Questions

## Main Research Question
**Survivability of charitable organisations – What factors influence whether a charity survives?**

## Sub-Research Questions

- **RQ1:** What organizational and temporal patterns distinguish surviving charities from those that cease operations?

- **RQ2:** How do governance quality and operational factors quantitatively impact charity survival probability?

- **RQ3:** How do financial characteristics and income patterns influence charity survival across different organizational segments?

- **RQ4:** How can advanced feature engineering and selection techniques improve model performance and reveal non-obvious survival predictors?

- **RQ5:** How can survival prediction models be operationalized to support evidence-based charity sector decision-making?
